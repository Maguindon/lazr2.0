      <h2>Dashboards for everyone!</h2>
      <p>
        Taking back control of your shipping process starts with knowing what's happening. We have designed around our
        platform around making the app getting you the info you need when you need it. Every business gets their own
        space in Lazr, in which you can work alongside your team and the actions are based on user type.
        <br>
        <br>
        More control means more visibility, you will get both using the dashboards created by our logistics scientists.
